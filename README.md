# Hi, I’m Scott

Hi, I’m Scott McKee. And I’ve been a web designer and developer for over 20 years. Over the years I helped small businesses, governments, and large companies. And even ran a web design agency.

I’m passionate about core web technology. And do my best to ensure my work follows <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium" aria-label="World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)" role="term">W3C</abbr> standards and shared best practices. Thinking about coding a <abbr title="User Interface" aria-label="User Interface (UI)" role="term">UI</abbr> when designing is also very helpful. It informs my design choices and results in more usable interfaces.
